PHP Console (all self-contained within index.php) is a handy script to test and run your PHP code snippets.
Instead of struggling with "php -a" (that usually doesn't work on Windows at all) you can just put index.php file somewhere 
on your local WEB server space and access it via:

http://localhost/index.php

This script will run your PHP snippets and show generated output.

WARNING: Do not upload it into your live Web Server! If hacker or even kiddie will get hold of it - he can destroy everything at your hosting account.
Use it only on your local web space available only to you.
